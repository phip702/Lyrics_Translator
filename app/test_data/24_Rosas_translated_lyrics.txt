[Letra de "24 Rosas"]


[Verse 1]
It me off that you tell me that I wronged you
If I was never the bad one in this story
It me off that you live in your reality
But in your reality you know inside
That all the promises were made of paper
How easy they flew with the wind
Today it may hurt that I'm with him
But it's just that you're long gone
And I, now that we're not together
I'm going to tell you that your honey hurt me
That you let go of my hand and in the middle of summer Madrid got cold (It got cold)
And while I waited for you
It was snowing in my heart
And this voice froze


[Chorus]
Now you're calling me
You say you love me
Let's come back together
Like that's going to happen
And it's not going to happen
That's not fair
Roses in bed
When I was about to let go
And now I'm crying again, wanting to forget you

[Verse 2]
Come back to my life, please, this won't happen again
You told me a thousand times "let's start over"
And I foolishly believed you because I loved you and I didn't see
That our love was dying and I was dying for you
But it's over
And don't tell me "I'm sorry", I'm sorry
In this we both lost
I know what you're suffering because now you're seeing that I'm better off
Ever since I said goodbye to you

[Chorus]
Now you're calling me
You say you love me
Let's come back together
Like that's going to happen
And it's not going to happen
That's not fair
Roses in bed
When I was about to let go
And now I'm crying again, wanting to forget you

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
And now I'm crying again, wanting to forget you
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
And now I'm crying again, wanting to forget you
(Wanting to forget you, wanting to forget you
Wanting to forget you, wanting to forget you)
